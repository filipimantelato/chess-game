# ♟️ Chess Game in Java

This project is a **pure Java application** that simulates a **chess game** playable via console.  
The goal is to apply concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, clean code practices, and programming logic.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Full representation of a chessboard using a **bidimensional matrix**.
- Implementation of **official chess rules** (valid moves, piece capturing, check and checkmate).
- **Turn control** between two players.
- Console display of the board and captured pieces.
- **Move validation** with exception handling to prevent invalid plays.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies used
- **Java 17+**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Enumerations
- **Exception handling** for game consistency.

---

## 📂 Project structure
- `boardgame/` → classes responsible for the board and positions.  
- `chess/` → chess rules and logic.  
- `chess.pieces/` → implementation of pieces (`King`, `Queen`, `Rook`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, `Pawn`).  
- `application/` → main class to run the game in console.
